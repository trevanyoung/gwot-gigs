GWOT Gigs is a job finding application specifically designed for combat veterans. It leverages APIs to populate data that users can search through to find suitable job opportunities. This README will provide you with a brief explanation of the technologies used in this application and guide you on how to start the React app.

Technologies Used
Typescript
GWOT Gigs is built using TypeScript, a statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds type checking to the language. TypeScript helps catch errors and provides better tooling and autocompletion, making the development process more robust and efficient.

React
The application is built with React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows for efficient component-based development, making it easier to manage complex UIs. It provides a declarative syntax and facilitates reusable and modular code, resulting in a more maintainable and scalable application.
